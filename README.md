As with cornflakes, the license is also LGPL3 as per LICENSE.txt. Note that the output of popcorn, the transpiled C and Python source, are free of this license, such that the C files may be freely incorporated into another software. However, I would appreciate a citation or the note that Popcorn was used to generate some of the source code in your documentation.
